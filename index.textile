p. Beanstalk + Tokyo Tyrant = Edamame, a fast persistent distributed priority job queue

"Edamame":http://bit.ly/edamame combines the "Beanstalk priority queue":http://bit.ly/beanstalkd with a "Tokyo Tyrant database"::http://bit.ly/ttyrant and "God monitoring":http://bit.ly/godmonitor to produce a persistent distributed priority job queue system.

h2(#description). Description

p(heavy). Like beanstalk, edamame:
* is *fast*, scalable, lightweight and distributed
* is a job queue, not just a messaging queue: it offers *priority job scheduling* (not just FIFO) and *reliable scheduling* (jobs that time out are re-assigned)
* supports multiple queues ('tubes')

p(heavy). Additionally, its lightweight backing store and monitoring scripts mean edamame:
* is *persistent* and recoverable
* allows you to query and enumerate jobs
* allows named jobs
* provides reasonably-good availability.

p(heavy). Edamame includes a few nifty toys:
* Scripts for "God":http://bit.ly/godmonitor to monitor and restart the daemons
* Command-line management scripts to load. enumerate, empty, and show stats for the db+queue
* The start of a lightweight web frontend in Sinatra.
